<# Notes
1.)  We added [cmdletbinding()]
This adds several additional features.  Not needed for this example.  Book doesn't cover this.
2.) Making parameters mandatory, creating aliases and the parameter is a string
+ [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)] - this decorator will prompt user for variable value
+ [HelpMessage="Enter a computername to query")] - provides a user prompt
+ [Alias()] - allows for parameter alias
+ Supports -Verbose switch.  Recall that the PowerShell supports various output streams.
The Information stream is intended for messages to understand what a script is doing
The Verbose stream is intended for troubleshooting.  Output is controlled with $VerbosePreference variable.
Default is $VerbosePreference = 'SilentlyContinue'.  Output is enable with 'Continue'
